#  Toy Block Factory

There is a factory that makes toy blocks. The blocks come in three different shapes (square, circle and triangle) and in three different colours (red, blue and yellow)

The factory does not keep any stock of blocks, instead blocks are produced per order. For example let's say the factory gets 3 orders in a day, the factory would make each order on it's own. 

An order consists of a combination of shapes and colors. Below is an example of what an order would look like:  

|          | Red | Blue | Yellow |  
|----------|-----|------|--------|  
| Square   | 1   | -    | 1      |  
| Triangle | -   | 2    | -      |  
| Circle   | -   | 1    | 2      |  




### Functionalities

Factory has an Order Management System that is able to take in single order details at a time. It also has a Report System to generate reports. 

This application can:
- Take orders
- Generate an Invoice Report per order
- Generating a Cutting List Report per order
- Generating a Painting Report per order
- Take bulk orders
- Generate Cutting List Reports due on a particular date
- Generate Painting Reports due on a particular date

Everything will be done via the console.
